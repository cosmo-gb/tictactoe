    "Understanding the Core RL Concepts for Tic-Tac-Toe\n",
    "\n",
    "Before anything else, let's define the fundamental components of Reinforcement Learning in the context of Tic-Tac-Toe:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Agent: This is the AI you are trying to teach. It's the \"player\" that will learn to make optimal moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Environment: This is the Tic-Tac-Toe game itself. It defines the rules, the board, and what happens when an action is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "    State: The current configuration of the Tic-Tac-Toe board. This is what the agent \"observes\" to decide its next move.\n",
    "\n",
    "        How to represent a state? Imagine the 3x3 board. Each cell can be empty, 'X', or 'O'. You could represent a state as a string (e.g., \"X_O__X_O_\") or a tuple of numbers (e.g., (1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0) where 1 is X, -1 is O, 0 is empty). The key is that each unique board configuration must map to a unique state representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Symmetry: Tic-tac-toe has symmetries (rotations, flips). You could try to \"normalize\" states by rotating/flipping them to a canonical form to reduce the number of unique states the agent needs to learn about, but for a first pass, don't worry about this optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Action: A move the agent can make in a given state. In Tic-Tac-Toe, an action is placing your mark ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "        How to represent an action? A number from 0 to 8, corresponding to the 9 cells on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Valid Actions: From any given state, only the empty cells are valid actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reward: A numerical feedback signal from the environment to the agent after it takes an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Winning: A positive reward (e.g., +1). This encourages the agent to make moves that lead to wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Losing: A negative reward (e.g., -1). This discourages moves that lead to losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Draw: A neutral reward (e.g., 0 or +0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Intermediate Moves (game not over): Typically, a small negative reward (e.g., -0.01) to encourage the agent to win quickly, or a zero reward (0) if you only care about the final outcome. For Tic-Tac-Toe, a reward only at the end of the game is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Policy: The agent's strategy. It's a mapping from states to actions. Initially, this policy is random. Over time, the agent learns to select actions that lead to higher rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Value Function (Q-value): This is what the agent learns. A Q-value Q(s,a) represents the expected future reward of taking action a in state s. The agent's goal is to learn a Q-function that tells it the best action to take in any given state."
